# Crafting Intepreters

I'm working through Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).  
This is the second half of the book, which the book does in C. If you're
interested in the first part of the book, I did it (but did not finish it) in
Rust, [if you wanna look](https://github.com/mmcclimon/crafting-interpreters-rust).
I also took a pass (but again, did not finish) at the second half of the book
already, [in Go](https://github.com/mmcclimon/crafting-interpreters-go), but
maybe this time I'll actually finish.
